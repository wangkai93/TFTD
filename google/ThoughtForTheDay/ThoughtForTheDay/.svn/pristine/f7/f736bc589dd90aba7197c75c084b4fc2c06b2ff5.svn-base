						Edgar Cayce (pronounced Kay-Cee, 
1877-1945) has been called the &#8220;sleeping prophet&#8221;, the &#8220;father of 
holistic medicine&#8221;, and the most documented psychic of the 20th century.
 For more than 40 years of his adult life, Cayce gave psychic &#8220;readings&#8221;
 to thousands of seekers while in an unconscious state, diagnosing 
illnesses and revealing lives lived in the past and prophecies yet to 
come. But who, exactly, was Edgar Cayce? Cayce was born on a farm in 
Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in 1877, and his psychic abilities began to 
appear as early as his childhood. He was able to see and talk to his 
late grandfather's spirit, and often played with &#8220;imaginary friends&#8221; 
whom he said were spirits on the other side. He also displayed an 
uncanny ability to memorize the pages of a book simply by sleeping on 
it. These gifts labeled the young Cayce as strange, but all Cayce really
 wanted was to help others, especially children.</span>

                <div>
                    <span style="text-align: left; width: 100%%;">Later 
in life, Cayce would find that he had the ability to put himself into a 
sleep-like state by lying down on a couch, closing his eyes, and folding
 his hands over his stomach. In this state of relaxation and meditation,
 he was able to place his mind in contact with all time and space &#8212; the 
universal consciousness, also known as the super-conscious mind. From 
there, he could respond to questions as broad as, &#8220;What are the secrets 
of the universe?&#8221; and &#8220;What is my purpose in life?&#8221; to as specific as, 
&#8220;What can I do to help my arthritis?&#8221; and &#8220;How were the pyramids of 
Egypt built?&#8221; His responses to these questions came to be called 
&#8220;readings&#8221;, and their insights offer practical help and advice to 
individuals even today. Many people are surprised to learn that Edgar 
Cayce was a devoted churchgoer and Sunday school teacher. At a young 
age, Cayce vowed to read the Bible for every year of his life, and at 
the time of his death in 1945, he had accomplished this task. Perhaps 
the readings said it best, when asked how to become psychic, Cayce&#8217;s 
advice was to become more spiritual.</span>

						<p>Although Cayce died more than 60 years 
ago, the timeliness of the material in the readings &#8212; with subjects like
 discovering your mission in life, developing your intuition, 
exploring ancient mysteries, and taking responsibility for your health &#8212;
 is evidenced by the hundreds of books that have been written on the 
various aspects of this work as well as the dozen or so titles focusing 
on Cayce's life itself. Together, these books contain information so 
valuable that even Edgar Cayce himself might have hesitated to predict
 their impact on the contemporary world. In 1945, the year of his 
passing, who could have known that terms such as &#8220;meditation&#8221;, &#8220;Akashic 
records&#8221;, &#8220;spiritual growth&#8221;, &#8220;auras&#8221;, &#8220;soul mates&#8221; and &#8220;holistic 
health&#8221; would become household words to millions?

The majority of Edgar Cayce's readings deal with holistic health and the
 treatment of illness. As it was at the time Cayce was giving readings, 
still today, individuals from all walks of life and belief receive 
physical relief from illnesses or ailments through information given in 
the readings &#8212; some readings were given as far back as 100 years ago! 
Yet, although best known for this material, the sleeping Cayce did not 
seem to be limited to concerns about the physical body. In fact, in 
their entirety, the readings discuss an astonishing 10,000 different 
topics. This vast array of subject matter can be narrowed down into a 
smaller group of topics that, when compiled together, deal with the following five categories: (1) 
Health-Related Information; (2) Philosophy and Reincarnation; (3) Dreams
 and Dream Interpretation; (4) ESP and Psychic Phenomena; and (5) 
Spiritual Growth, Meditation, and Prayer.
